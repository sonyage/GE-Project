This is a simple HTML/CSS/JS CRUD web app. No unit tests or infrastructure required.
The index.html file is a login file that takes you to the registering page.
Due to not having an actual login database, any login works, but both fields 
must be filled out.

Due to ~1 hour time limit, I was not able to implement all features I wanted to and
there is bugs. This is mostly due to not being as comfortable with JS as I am with 
C++. Given the opportunity to work with one of the teams at Guild, I would make sure 
to be more practiced in the languages and other technologies used by the team in 
order to be as much of an asset as possible. 

Thank you for taking the time to review my sample.
